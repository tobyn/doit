# Future Ideas

Ideas to revisit later. These are not committed designs — just things
worth thinking about when the time is right.

## Compound doc comments from nested calls

When a function call has a `#!` comment and the expanded instructions also
have their own `#!` comments, it might be useful to build compound
comments that combine both levels (e.g., `"Greeting sequence / Says
hello"`). The syntax for this hasn't been decided yet.

## Range type for `for` loops

A compile-time range type could enable `for` loop syntax. The VM has no
range type — a range would be represented as two numeric registers
(start and end) at runtime, with the compiler tracking metadata like
whether the range is inclusive or half-open and generating the
appropriate `check_number` + body loop structure. Similar to how
strings are compile-time-only types baked into instructions, the
"range" concept would exist only in the compiler's type system.
